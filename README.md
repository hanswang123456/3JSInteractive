# Three.js boilerplate
This boilerplate is a clone of [this](https://github.com/learnthreejs/three-js-boilerplate) which is the basic setup of THREE.js hosted on port 8080 when ran locally.

# THREE.js
The project is a clone of basic Minecraft with building and deletion of blocks in various styles. It utilizes raycaster collison to detect blocks/interacting with blocks.

# Game setup
The game operates with wsad keys for movement, left-click for placing blocks, right-click holds of around 1 second to remove blocks, and the scroll wheel to translate on the y-axis(flying upwards/downwards)
