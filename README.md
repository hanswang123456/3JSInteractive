#THREE.js
The project is a clone of basic Minecraft with building and deletion of blocks in various styles.

#Game setup
The game operates with wsad keys for movement, left-click for placing blocks, right-click holds of around 1 second to remove blocks, and the scroll wheel to translate on the y-axis(flying upwards/downwards)
